### Why do this?

 - Open Data api from the city is super slow, you can't use it to build anything meaningful because it'll probably slow down even further
 - 4+ years worth of data is enough to analyze 
 - as a citizen , it is simply interesting and responsible to analyze what our city does and how it performs





 ## Notes about data

 - "status_notes": "In progress - The request is being investigated, assessed and/or responded to; additional work may be required, if applicable.",
 - "status_notes": "Completed - The request has been concluded.",
 - "status_notes": "In progress - The request has been scheduled.",
 - status is open or closed
 - agency_responsible is always 311 Toronto
 - most are "service_name": "Road - Pot hole", or "...... Graffiti Complaint"
 - lat/lng and address can be null - Weird, where did the work occur
